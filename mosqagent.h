/**
 * \brief De-allocator function pointer
 *
 * The de-allocator is responsible for cleaning up a pointer and possible
 * heap structures in the pointed-to struct. The exact handling is based
 * on the struct, so the user (or the library) has to provide the correct
 * de-allocator for each memory object.
 *
 * Providing `NULL` as de-allocator reference will be interpreted as
 * "no de-allocation", i.e. the object will be left alone. Use this for stack
 * pointers of if clean-up is handled somewhere else.
 *
 * \note The de-allocator is also responsible for cleaning up the pointed-to
 * memory. The pendant for `malloc`-created objects would be a pointer to
 * `free`.
